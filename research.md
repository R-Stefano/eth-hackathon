Project ImmunoSteer: A Computational Framework for the Dynamic Control of Senescence Immunogenicity1. IntroductionThe therapeutic targeting of cellular senescence represents one of the most promising frontiers in modern medicine, offering the potential to ameliorate a vast array of age-related pathologies, from pulmonary fibrosis to neurodegeneration. However, the prevailing paradigm of senolytics—agents designed to selectively eliminate senescent cells—faces a critical bottleneck: heterogeneity. Senescent cells (SnCs) are not a monolithic population but a complex, heterogeneous manifold of cellular states driven by diverse stressors, lineages, and microenvironmental cues. The recent development of the Senescent Cell Identification (SenCID) program by Tao et al. (2024) has fundamentally restructured our understanding of this landscape, identifying at least six distinct Senescence Identities (SIDs) that exhibit divergent transcriptional profiles, metabolic activities, and survival mechanisms.1A pivotal challenge within this heterogeneity is the variability in immunogenicity. While some senescent phenotypes are "hot," characterized by a robust Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) and high surface ligand expression that recruits immune clearance, others are "cold," effectively evading surveillance by the adaptive immune system. This report proposes "Project ImmunoSteer," a comprehensive design for a 24-hour hackathon project. The objective is to engineer a "Dynamic Model Control" system that does not merely identify or kill senescent cells but actively steers them from low-visibility, evasive states into "High-Immunogenicity" trajectories amenable to T-cell targeting. By leveraging the high-dimensional single-cell trajectory and Perturb-seq data provided by the SenCID study, we aim to develop a computational workflow that predicts the precise genetic or pharmacological perturbations required to modulate the senescent state vector toward enhanced MHC-I presentation and biomarker visibility.This document serves as an exhaustive technical manual for the proposed project. It delineates the theoretical underpinnings of senescence heterogeneity, the architecture of the proposed control algorithm, the integration of multi-modal single-cell datasets, and the implementation strategy for the hackathon team. The ultimate deliverable is a predictive engine capable of navigating the senescence manifold, transforming immune evasion into immune recognition.2. Theoretical Framework: The Senescence Manifold and Control Theory2.1 The Paradigm of Senescence HeterogeneityHistorically, cellular senescence was viewed through a binary lens—a cell was either proliferative or senescent. This view has been rendered obsolete by high-resolution transcriptomics. The SenCID study utilized a Recursive Feature Elimination Support Vector Machine (SVM-RFE) approach to dissect the transcriptomes of 602 samples across 52 studies, revealing a structured heterogeneity.1The identification of six SIDs provides the coordinate system for our control model. Understanding the biological nuance of each identity is prerequisite to steering them:Table 1: The Senescence Identity (SID) Landscape and Immunogenicity PotentialSIDPrimary Biological FeaturesKey Gene SignaturesImmunogenicity Status (Baseline)SID1High SASP, Inflammation, Fibrotic factorsIL6, IL8, CXCLs, MMPsHigh (Hot). Naturally recruits immune cells via chemokine gradients.SID2Lipid/Nucleotide Synthesis, Antigen PresentationHLA-A/B/C, B2M, FASNTarget State. Enriched for "antigen processing and presentation of endogenous antigen".1SID3Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Redox Stress, Locomotor RhythmSOD2, CAT, OXPHOS genesLow (Cold). Metabolic stress dominates; lacks strong surface presentation signals.SID4Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), ER StressHSPA5, ATF4, XBP1Moderate/Evasive. UPR may suppress MHC-I surface trafficking.SID5High Inflammation, Anti-Apoptotic (BCL-2) dependenceBCL2, NFkB targets, Ribosome downregulationMixed. High cytokine release but strongly resistant to apoptosis; requires T-cell cytotoxicity.SID6Cancer-associated (p53-deficient), Ribosome lossCDK1 (dysregulated), Myeloid activationVariable/Evasive. Often associated with tumor immune evasion mechanisms.The crucial insight for Project ImmunoSteer is the specific enrichment of "antigen processing and presentation of endogenous antigen" in SID2.1 This defines our control objective: to steer cells, particularly those in "cold" metabolic states like SID3 or evasive states like SID4, toward the transcriptional coordinates of SID2.2.2 The Immunogenicity Gap and T-Cell TargetingEffective T-cell clearance of senescent cells requires two signals: peptide-MHC-I complex recognition (Signal 1) and co-stimulation/inflammation (Signal 2). The SenCID data suggests a decoupling of these signals across SIDs. SID1 and SID5 are rich in Signal 2 (inflammation) but may lack the surface presentation machinery of Signal 1. Conversely, SID3 cells, characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, often downregulate the cytosolic translation machinery required for peptide generation, rendering them invisible to CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells.1The "High-Immunogenicity" state ($S_{target}$) must therefore be defined as a hybrid vector: combining the antigen presentation machinery of SID2 with the chemokine attraction profile of SID1/5. Steering a cell into this state ensures it is both visible (MHC-I high) and attractive (Chemokine high) to the immune system.2.3 Dynamic Model Control in Transcriptomic SpaceControl theory involves manipulating a system's inputs to guide its state variable $x(t)$ to a reference $x_{ref}$. In biological context, the state $x$ is the high-dimensional gene expression vector of a single cell. The "inputs" $u$ are genetic perturbations (e.g., CRISPR knockdowns or activations) or pharmacological agents that mimic them. The system dynamics are governed by the gene regulatory network (GRN).The novelty of the SenCID dataset, particularly the Perturb-seq data, is that it provides a localized linearization of the system dynamics. For a given perturbation $u_i$, we observe the shift vector $\Delta x_i = x_{perturbed} - x_{control}$. "Project ImmunoSteer" treats the selection of optimal senolytic strategies as an optimal control problem: minimize the distance $J = ||(x_{current} + \Delta x_i) - x_{target}||$, subject to constraints (e.g., maintaining cell cycle arrest to prevent tumorigenesis).3. Data Infrastructure: The Atlas for Hackathon IngestionA successful hackathon project requires precisely curated datasets. We identify three critical data streams from the SenCID study that constitute the project's infrastructure.3.1 The Reference Atlas: Bulk Transcriptome Dataset (BTD)The BTD is the foundational map for the project. Comprising 602 samples across 30 cell types, it is the training ground for the SID classifiers.1 The project team must ingest this data to construct the "Sensor" module of the control system.The dataset's value lies in its breadth. It captures senescence driven by diverse inducers—oncogene activation, replication exhaustion, DNA damage, and oxidative stress. This diversity allows the control model to learn robust, generalized signatures of immunogenicity (SID2) versus evasion (SID3/4), rather than overfitting to a specific cell line. The 1,290 Senescence-Related Genes (SRGs) identified by Tao et al. serve as the reduced-dimension feature space for the control algorithm, simplifying the computational load for a 24-hour sprint.13.2 The Action Space: Perturb-seq DatasetsTo steer a cell, one must know the effect of pulling a lever. The Perturb-seq data from the SenCID study provides this cause-and-effect mapping.RPE1 (Retinal Pigment Epithelial) Dataset: This is the primary dataset for modeling "normal" tissue senescence. RPE1 cells naturally fall into SID3.1 The dataset includes single-cell transcriptomes following CRISPR interference of ~2,500 essential genes. This provides ~2,500 potential "steering vectors."K562 (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia) Dataset: Representing SID6 (p53-deficient).1 While less relevant for aging therapeutics, it provides a crucial negative control—highlighting how p53 deficiency alters the response to perturbations, often decoupling stress from immunogenicity.The hackathon team must analyze the 8 functional groups of senescence-promoting perturbations identified in RPE1 cells. Crucially, the paper notes that Group 2 perturbations (targeting DNA replication and chromosome segregation, e.g., AURKB, NCL) are "central determinators" of senescence.1 However, Group 2 also triggers specific "lysosomal and autophagy" signatures.1 The team must determine if this autophagy degrades MHC-I (immune evasion) or processes antigens (immune presentation), thereby deciding if Group 2 is a viable steering input.3.3 The Temporal Trajectory: Single-Cell Time SeriesStatic snapshots are insufficient for dynamic control; temporal resolution is required. The dataset from Chan et al. (GSE175533), analyzed in SenCID, tracks lung fibroblasts through replicative senescence (Population Doubling Levels, PDLs).1This dataset allows the team to model the "natural drift" of the system. The SenCID analysis shows that SID scores increase progressively with PDL, often spiking at the very end (PDL 50).1 The control algorithm must be tested on this trajectory: can a perturbation applied at PDL 40 (pre-senescence) deflect the cell from a low-immunogenicity endpoint to a high-immunogenicity one?4. The ImmunoSteer Algorithm: Architecture and LogicThe core deliverable of the hackathon is the "ImmunoSteer" algorithm. This section details the mathematical and logical structure of the proposed model, designed to be coded within the 24-hour window.4.1 Module 1: The State Estimator (The Compass)Before steering, the system must locate the cell in the SID manifold. The inputs are raw single-cell RNA-seq counts ($C_{raw}$).Preprocessing Logic:Given the sparsity of single-cell data, the paper emphasizes the necessity of imputation. The algorithm must implement a Deep Count Autoencoder (DCA) to denoise $C_{raw}$.1 Without DCA, critical low-expression markers like transcription factors or MHC ligands may be lost, blinding the steering engine.Classification Logic:The estimator applies the trained SVM-RFE models. It projects the imputed cell profile $x$ onto the six hyperplanes defined by the SIDs.$$P(SID_k | x) = \sigma(w_k \cdot x + b_k)$$Where $w_k$ and $b_k$ are the weight vector and bias for SID $k$ derived from the BTD, and $\sigma$ is the logistic function. The output is a probability distribution over the SIDs, defining the cell's current "Identity State."4.2 Module 2: The Target Definition (The Destination)The "High-Immunogenicity" state ($S_{target}$) is defined based on the SenCID functional enrichment analysis. It is not simply "SID2" but a refined sub-region of the SID2/SID1 space.Defining the Vector $V_{imm}$:The target centroid is constructed by maximizing the expression of genes in two key Gene Ontology (GO) terms enriched in the paper:Antigen Processing and Presentation: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, B2M, TAP1, TAP2, PSMB8, PSMB9. (Primary SID2 feature).Lymphocyte Recruitment (Chemotaxis): CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL2, ICAM1. (Primary SID1/5 feature).The paper notes that AT2 cells in aged lungs (SID2) exhibit high cell-cell interactions.1 This connectivity is the desired phenotypic outcome. Thus, $S_{target}$ is a synthetic vector blending the presentation machinery of SID2 with the secretory capacity of SID1.4.3 Module 3: The Steering Engine (The Actuator)This module selects the optimal perturbation. It utilizes the Perturb-seq data as a lookup table of "Shift Vectors."The Optimization Problem:For a given cell in state $x_{current}$, we seek a perturbation $u$ (from the set of CRISPR guides $U$) that minimizes the angle $\theta$ between the predicted trajectory and the target vector $V_{imm}$.$$\Delta x_u = \text{Mean}(x_{perturbed, u}) - \text{Mean}(x_{control})$$$$\text{Score}(u) = \text{CosineSimilarity}(\Delta x_u, (S_{target} - x_{current}))$$Refining the Action Space (The 8 Groups):The hackathon team must programmatically filter the perturbation groups based on biological logic derived from the paper:Group 2 (DNA Segregation): Triggers deep senescence via p53/RB. The paper links this to the "DNA replication and chromosome segregation" functional block.1 This is the "Brake" that ensures cell cycle arrest (a safety constraint).Group 7 (Golgi Transport): The paper identifies this as a senescence-promoting group.1 However, inhibiting the Golgi (e.g., TRAPP complex) likely blocks MHC-I surface transport. Therefore, the algorithm should apply a penalty to Group 7 targets for this specific objective.Group 4 (Proteasome): Inhibiting the proteasome induces stress (SID4) but can also increase the pool of peptides available for MHC loading. The algorithm should evaluate if Group 4 shifts the vector toward $V_{imm}$.4.4 Module 4: The Regulatory Validator (eResponseNet)A perturbation might look good mathematically but fail biologically if the signaling pathway is broken. The SenCID study utilizes eResponseNet to map information flow from perturbation sources to transcriptional effects via a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network.1Hackathon Implementation:Running full eResponseNet optimization is computationally expensive. The hackathon project will implement a "Lite" version using the Mediator Analysis results from the paper.Key Mediators: The paper identifies AURKB, NCL, ASF1B, CDC45 as common mediators for Group 2-driven senescence.1Logic: The algorithm checks connectivity. Does the candidate perturbation $u$ have a high-confidence PPI path to the HLA or NFkB regulons?Insight: The paper notes that Group 2 acts as a "central determinator" through which other groups flow.1 If the steering perturbation bypasses Group 2 mediators, it might fail to induce the necessary stable arrest.5. Execution Plan: The 24-Hour Hackathon WorkflowTo ensure feasibility, the project is divided into four distinct operational phases.Phase 1: Ingestion and Calibration (Hours 0-6)Objective: Establish the computational environment and validate the "Sensor."The team begins by initializing a Python/R environment with Scanpy, Seurat, and the SenCID package. The BTD is ingested, and the SVM-RFE classifiers are retrained. A critical success metric in this phase is reproducing the paper's AUC values (>0.90 for most cell types).1 This confirms that the coordinate system is calibrated.Simultaneously, the team extracts the specific gene signatures for "High-Immunogenicity." They perform a differential expression analysis on the BTD, specifically comparing SID2 samples against all others to isolate the HLA-enriched cluster. This empirically defines the $S_{target}$ vector coordinates.Phase 2: Vector Mapping and Filtering (Hours 6-12)Objective: Map the Perturbation Library and filter for safety and efficacy.The team processes the RPE1 Perturb-seq data. For each of the ~2,500 gene knockdowns, a "Shift Vector" is calculated.Safety Filter: Perturbations that fail to induce cell cycle arrest markers (e.g., fail to upregulate p16/CDKN2A or p21/CDKN1A) are discarded. We are designing a senolytic steering system, not a tumorigenic one.Immunogenicity Scoring: The remaining vectors are scored against the $V_{imm}$ target. The team analyzes the 8 Perturbation Groups.Hypothesis Check: Does "Group 1" (Ribosome knockdown), which mimics SID1/5 features (low ribosome), naturally increase inflammation? If so, it is a strong candidate for recruiting T-cells.Investigating Suppressors: The paper identifies PGD (Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase) and PTEN as senescence suppressors.1 Knocking them down prevents senescence. However, in a control context, perhaps inhibiting the pathways they suppress (or activating them) steers the phenotype. The algorithm should flag these nodes as "Inversion Points."Phase 3: Algorithm Assembly and Simulation (Hours 12-18)Objective: Code the "ImmunoSteer" engine and simulate trajectories.The team integrates the State Estimator, Target Definition, and Steering Engine into a unified function.To test the engine, they utilize the Lung Fibroblast time-series data.1Selection: Pick cells at "Pre-Senescence" (e.g., PDL 35).Simulation: Apply the "Shift Vector" of the top-ranked perturbation (e.g., NCL knockdown) to these cells in silico.Projection: Project the "Simulated" cells onto the SID landscape.Success Metric: Does the simulated cell move from the SID3 (fibroblast baseline) trajectory toward the SID2 (immunogenic) region?Failure Mode: Does it move toward SID4 (UPR/Stress) without antigen presentation?Phase 4: Validation and Visualization (Hours 18-24)Objective: Generate the final output and interpretable visualizations.The team generates a "Steering Map"—a UMAP visualization overlaying the natural senescent trajectory (Grey) with the "Steered" trajectory (Blue). Arrows indicate the force vectors of the proposed perturbations.Final outputs are generated: a ranked table of "Immuno-Switch" targets, annotated with their predicted mechanism (e.g., "Target X: Induces Cell Cycle Arrest via Group 2 pathway AND upregulates MHC-I via NFkB disinhibition").6. Biological Insights and Nuances for the Control ModelThe integration of SenCID data reveals profound biological constraints and opportunities that the control model must navigate.6.1 The Autocrine Loop TrapA critical insight from the SenCID analysis of AT2 cells in lung disease is the prevalence of autocrine loops. The paper notes that senescent cells often secrete ligands that bind to their own receptors (e.g., VCAN-EGFR in chondrocytes, CCL2-ACKR4 in fibroblasts), reinforcing their specific SID state.1Implication for Steering: A cell "stuck" in a specific SID might be locked there by a feedback loop. The "ImmunoSteer" algorithm must check for these specific ligand-receptor pairs in the target cell's transcriptome. If a loop is detected, the steering strategy must explicitly include an inhibitor for that receptor (e.g., blocking EGFR in chondrocytes) to "unlock" the state before steering it toward immunogenicity.6.2 The Ribosomal ConnectionThe SenCID study reveals a significant negative correlation between cytosolic ribosome expression and the "Basal Senescence Score" (BSS) in SID1, 5, and 6.1 However, this correlation is absent in other SIDs.Implication for Steering: The ribosome biogenesis pathway (Group 1 perturbations) acts as a master switch for the inflammatory SIDs (1/5). If the goal is to induce high inflammation (Signal 2 for T-cells), targeting ribosomal proteins (e.g., RPL5, RPS6) is a high-probability strategy. The control model should prioritize Group 1 targets when the patient's cells are "cold" (low inflammation), effectively mimicking the SID1 phenotype to recruit immune effectors.6.3 The Stemness-Senescence InverseThe paper establishes a robust inverse relationship between Signaling Entropy (a proxy for stemness/plasticity) and senescence severity.1Implication for Steering: Steering a deeply senescent cell (low entropy) is difficult because its state is rigid. A sophisticated control strategy might involve a "Pulse-and-Glide" approach:Pulse: Transiently apply a perturbation that increases entropy (e.g., a mild reprogramming factor or chromatin remodeler) to "soften" the state.Glide: Apply the directional perturbation (e.g., Group 2 target) to lock it into the high-immunogenicity attractor.While the hackathon might not fully simulate step 1, the algorithm can weight perturbations that affect chromatin accessibility (often found in Group 2/8) higher, as they likely possess greater "steering authority."7. Anticipated Results and Final OutputThe execution of Project ImmunoSteer is expected to yield a ranked list of therapeutic targets—genetic "steering wheels"—that convert cryptic senescent cells into conspicuous targets for the immune system.The Final Output Package:The "Immuno-Switch" Target List: A ranked table of genes (e.g., NCL, AURKB, RPL family members) whose inhibition is predicted to induce the $V_{imm}$ signature.State Transition Diagrams: Visualizations showing the vector fields of the top 5 perturbations, demonstrating how they warp the transcriptional landscape to funnel cells into the SID2 basin of attraction.The "Steer-to-Clear" Protocol: A logic-gated therapeutic strategy.IF Cell is SID3 (Mitochondrial/Cold) $\rightarrow$ APPLY Proteasome Inhibitor (Group 4) to boost peptide availability + Ribosome Inhibitor (Group 1) to induce cytokines.IF Cell is SID5 (BCL2/Protected) $\rightarrow$ APPLY BCL-2 Inhibitor (Senolysis) OR APPLY MHC-I inducer to trigger T-cell killing.ConclusionProject ImmunoSteer represents a paradigm shift from static senolysis to dynamic cell state engineering. By harnessing the deep resolution of the SenCID atlas—specifically the SID2 antigen-presentation signature and the Perturb-seq causal maps—this hackathon project provides a blueprint for the next generation of "smart" senolytics. It addresses the fundamental challenge of heterogeneity not by ignoring it, but by utilizing it as a navigational chart, turning the complexity of senescence into a controllable therapeutic variable.Table 2: Summary of Hackathon Data Assets and UtilizationDataset NameSource Paper ContextHackathon FunctionKey Insight for Control LogicBTD (Bulk Transcriptome)602 samples, 30 cell types, 6 SIDs 1Training Set.
